You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/trevorb1/SEE-891/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Purpose

GitHub pages are static websites that can be linked to any GitHub project or organization.

#GitHub Pages can support syntax highlighted code blocks 

for item in ['hero', 'god']:
  print(f'Trevor is a {item}')
```
